            The Indianapolis Colts are a professional American football team based in Indianapolis. The Colts compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) South division. Since the 2008 season, the Colts have played their games in Lucas Oil Stadium. Previously, the team had played for over two decades (1984â€“2007) at the RCA Dome. Since 1987, the Colts have served as the host team for the NFL Scouting Combine.

The Colts have competed as a member club of the NFL 
since their founding in Baltimore in 1953 after then-owner 
Carroll Rosenbloom purchased the assets of the NFL's last founding Ohio League member
 Dayton Triangles-Dallas Texans franchise. They were one of three NFL teams to join those of the American Football League +
 (AFL) to form the AFC following the 1970 merger. While in 
 Baltimore, the team advanced to the playoffs 10 times and 
 won three NFL Championship games in 1958, 1959, and 1968. The
  Colts played in two Super Bowl games while they were based in Baltimore, losing to the New York Jets in Super Bowl III and defeating the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V. The Colts relocated to Indianapolis in 1984 and have since appeared in the playoffs 16 times, won two conference championships, and won one Super Bowl, in which
 they defeated the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI.
